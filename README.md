# Safe-Zone-Maker
<b>Safe Zone Maker </b>is our first year hardware project. This system allows us to enter only customers who are not infected with Covid-19 into a public place (Eg: Shopping Mall).

<h3>Aim:</h3>
Design and develop an automated system smart door to make the entrance for limited people without manâ€™s interference to ensure Covid safety. 

<h3>Objectives:</h3>
<ul>
<li>To minimize the Covid risk for employees and employers by measuring the temperature and sanitizing hands and limiting customers. </li>
<li>To get rid of the human errors while the procedure is going on by using an entire machinery system other than using human labour. </li>
<li>To divert the human labour to another fruitful task.</li>
<li>To minimize unnecessary expenditures in the relevant task by replacing an automated system to the human laboring system. </li>
<li>To enhance the efficiency with less time-consuming.</ul>
